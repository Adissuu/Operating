# Description
In a client-server system, the client application sends requests to a server application
through a network connection. In such system, the user interface is implemented in the
client and the database is stored in the server.
This is a client-server application to process banking
transactions such as withdrawals and deposits. In modern banking systems, a costumer
accesses a bank account using an access card at an ATM, at the counter or on the web.
